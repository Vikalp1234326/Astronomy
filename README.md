In this folder you can find general codes for working with data in astrophysics I will keep on updating the folder as I upload the codes, additionally for majoity of codes I might not upload the data as some datasets
are really huge so I will provide the link here in the readme file for uploaded python scripts and you can download the data from the link and play around with the data.
